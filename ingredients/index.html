            <h3>Why is there so much grain?</h3>
            <p>In simple terms, the brewing process for beer works as follows:</p>
            
            <div class="brewing-process">
                <div class="brew-steps">
                    <div class="brew-step">
                        <p class="step-no">1</p>
                        <div>
                            <h4>We start with “the mash” where water is run through grain</h4>
                            <p>This creates “wort” - sugary water</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="brew-step">
                        <p class="step-no">2</p>
                        <div>
                            <h4>The wort is put into a Kettle with some hops and brought to the boil</h4>
                            <p>The hops give flavour, aroma and bitterness</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="brew-step">
                        <p class="step-no">3</p>
                        <div>
                            <h4>The wort is then cooled and put in a fermenting vessel with some yeast</h4>
                            <p>The yeast eats the sugar and creates CO2 and alcohol</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="brew-step">
                        <p class="step-no">4</p>
                        <div>
                            <h4>The beer is then often left to condition</h4>
                            <p>It can soon be packaged into casks, kegs, bottles or cans!</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

            <p>It takes about 1kg of grain to produce 10 pints of beer. Breweries across Europe produce around 3.4million tonnes of “spent grain” a year.</p>
