            <p>Breweries across Europe produce around 3.4million tonnes of “spent grain” a year.</p>

                    So are there any hops or alcohol in the biscuits?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The grain is only used in the mash, at the beginning of the process. This is before hops and yeast are added, so there won’t be any contact with hops or alcohol. Which is good as both are dangerous to dogs!

                <p>
                    It would be impossible to make the biscuits entirely out of grain, so we’ve added:

            <h3>
                Is it good for my dog?
            </h3>
            <p>
                There are plenty of health benefits to the dog. The grain is 20% plant protein and 70% fibre. The protein helps your dog grow and it’s immune system, whereas the fibre is good for the dog’s digestion.
            </p>

            <p>
                We’ve also added flaxseed, which contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids that are great for giving your dog a shiny coat!
            </p>

            <h3>
                So is it Vegan?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Yes! So these are great if you need to keep your dog away from animal products for a bit.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Wait, but isn’t grain bad for dogs?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Well, no.<br>
                If your dog has a grain/gluten allergy, then yes, grain will be bad for your dog. But that’s quite uncommon. In fact, your dog is much <a href="https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2017/01/food-allergies/">more likely to be allergic to animal protein</a>!
            </p>
            <p>
                There is very <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/grainfree-pet-food-trend-_b_5429538?guccounter=1">little evidence to support the grain-free movement</a>, and studies show that <a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1181&context=honors">some grain in the diet is better</a> than a strict high protein diet.
                
            </p>
            <h3>
                So, can these biscuits form the main part of a dog’s diet?
            </h3>
            <p>
                No. Whilst there are health benefits, these are made to be a treat. A dog needs a more varied range of nutrients than these biscuits provide for a healthy diet.
